# Digital Audio Processing
Apr 2020

These are the materials from the course [Digital Audio Processing](https://feit.ukim.edu.mk/subject/digitalno-procesira-e-na-audio/), taught in the 6th semester at the undergraduate level at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies](http://feit.ukim.edu.mk), [Ss Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje](http://ukim.edu.mk/), Macedonia.

The course focuses on the analysis, processing, compression and synthesis of digital audio and speech signals.
All the algorithms are implemented using Python 3.6, using Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib.
The whole installation procedure to get going is documented in the lecture materials.

There are [hands-on demo videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_M3K_x3m7Q&list=PLvPk4nlk33ahaXhf_XDuYjZ_WNHDTEz3c) of the practical part of the course available on the [FEEIT Free Course Ware YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2nTy42VUZjfTJHSJxx5Ejg).
